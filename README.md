##Lessons learned
This was my first attempt at bringing together all the different parts of a website. The base functionality was fairly simple since I was working with only one table. Integrating the functionality into a css template was more difficult than I originally thought it would be but I was able to practice with the developer tools on google chrome to help me troubleshoot.
